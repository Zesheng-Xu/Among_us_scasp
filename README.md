This Project is meant to model agent behavior and interaction similar to the environment present in the popular muder and mystery game Among Us - where there are different parties of agents that are hostile to each other and have very different behavior and objectives. Our objective here is to model their behavior and knowledge with logic programming tool s(CASP). The agents will behave not only according to global rules set already, but also to theire perception and assumption of other agents and given knowldge that are dynamic based on the action of all agents. Python is used to help establishing  paramaters for the s(CASP) to run and create knowledge as the simulation progresses.
